# IIT--Data-Visualization-Remote-Internship
This repository documents my 4-week Data Visualization Remote Internship under "Illinois Institute of Technology" in Chicago,USA through "Excelerate" website, focused on learning analytics, user behavior analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard-driven insights using real learner interaction data from the Excelerate learning platform.

# 📇 Internship Overview
•Dataset (Raw): SLU Opportunity Wise Data
•Dataset (Cleaned): Cleaned_SLU_Opportunity_Wise_Dataset
•Tools: Python, Excel, Power BI, Canva

# Techniques & Focus Areas:
•Data cleaning & Preprocessing
•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•Learner engagement & pathway analysis
•Feature/variable identification
•Predictive performance modeling
•Data visualization & dashboard design
•Learning path optimization & recommendations

# 🗓️ Weekly Tasks Breakdown
•Week 1: Performed initial EDA on learner interaction data, identified key engagement patterns, proposed predictive variables, and mapped a sample learning path.
•Week 2: Built a baseline learner performance prediction model and created visualizations to analyze user progression, drop-offs, and success patterns.
•Week 3: Compared pathway performance, identified bottlenecks, refined models/dashboards, and proposed data-driven learning path optimizations.
•Week 4: Developed the final interactive dashboard, consolidated multi-week insights, and delivered strategic recommendations through reports and presentations.

# 🎯 Outcome
This internship resulted in an end-to-end analytics workflow, transforming raw learner data into actionable insights through predictive modeling and interactive dashboards. The project strengthened my skills in data analysis, visualization, storytelling, and translating analytics into product-level learning experience improvements.
